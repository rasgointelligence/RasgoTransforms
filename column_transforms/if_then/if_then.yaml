name: if_then
description: |
  This function creates a new column based on the conditions provided in the `conditions` argument.

  Output values should be of the same type, since they are constructing one new column.

  A default value for the new column should be set, as should the output column name.
arguments:
  conditions:
    type: conditional_list
    description: A nested list. In each inner list the first element would be the condition to check, and the second the value with which to fill.
  default:
    type: mixed_value
    description: The default value with which to fill the new column. Please enclose fixed strings in quotes inside of the argument (e.g., below)
  alias:
    type: string
    description: The name of the output column in the new dataset.
