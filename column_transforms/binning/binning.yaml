name: binning
description: |
  This function will categorize or bin an input column such that for N bins, an output column is created with values `[1-N]` where each value represents some bin.

  This transformation supports two binning methods (called "binning_type" in the arguments): `ntile` and `equalwidth`.

  ## N-tile
  When using `ntile` binnint the boundaries for the bins are calculated such that each bin will receive an almost equal number of elements. It will create a new column called {{col_to_bin}}_{{bin_count}}_NTB. This ensures that multiple equal-weight binning operations will produce column names that don't overlap.

  ## Equal Width
  The `equalwidth` method will calculate the boundraies of the such that they will be of equal width based on the min and max value within the source column. This transformation will create a new column called {{col_to_bin}}_{{bin_count}}_EWB. This ensures that multiple equal-weight binning operations will produce column names that don't overlap.
