# Rasgo Transforms

Rasgo Transforms provide jinja SQL templates that can be applied to your data using rasgoQL, a pandas-like python package.
- Transforms are equivalent to SQL functions that accept a table or view from your eixsting DataWarehouse and return a SQL string to transform it
- Rasgo has built a starter library of transforms for you to use or fork
- *Coming Soon:* Users will be able to create their own Transforms and add them to a private namespace or contribute to the open-source library

# Running Transforms

Rasgo Transforms can be applied via:
- your Rasgo Feature Store account ([pyrasgo](https://pypi.org/project/pyrasgo/) - Account required)
- using the Rasgo open-source package ([rasgoql](https://pypi.org/project/rasgoql/) - totally free).

# About Us
Rasgo Transforms are maintained by *[Rasgo](https://rasgoml.com)*. Rasgo's enterprise feature store integrates with your data warehouse to help users build features faster, collaborate with team members, and serve features to models in production.
