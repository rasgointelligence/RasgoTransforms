# Rasgo Transforms

Rasgo Transforms provide jinja SQL templates that can be applied to your data using rasgoQL, a pandas-like python package.
- Transforms are equivalent to SQL functions that accept a table or view from your eixsting DataWarehouse and return a SQL string to transform it
- Rasgo has built a starter library of transforms for you to use or fork
- *Coming Soon:* Users will be able to create their own Transforms and add them to a private namespace or contribute to the open-source library

# Writing Transforms

Transforms are SQL templates that are rendered using arguments that we define in a config `.yaml.` file. To add a transform, you must include the jinja template file which produces the SQL, the config yaml file which defines the arguments needed for the template to render, and optionally, a python file with the `infer_columns` function implemented which is used to infer the columns their types of a table created from a transform's sql query.

The new transform should be added to the projects file structure like this:

```
rasgotransforms/rasgotransforms/transforms/
    <transform name>/
        <data warehouse type (optional)>/
            <transform name>.sql
            <transform name>.yaml
        <transform name>.sql
        <transform name>.yaml
        <transform name>.py
```

If the sql for a template needs to render differently for specific data warehouse types, then additional template and config definitions can be added under a data warehouse specific directory (e.g. 'snowflake')

# Inferring Columns

RasgoTransforms has the ability to infer the column names and data types from a SQL query generated by one of the templates using the `infer_columns` function.

To enable column inference for a transform, the python file for the transform must contain a python function which takes the arguments and source columns and returns a dictionary mapping the column names to their types. The required structure is like this:

```python
def infer_columns(args, source_columns) -> dict:
    out_columns = source_columns.copy()
    # Logic which determines columns output from the query...
    out_columns['new_column'] = 'new_column_type'
    return out_columns
```

# Running Transforms

Rasgo Transforms can be applied via:
- your Rasgo Feature Store account ([pyrasgo](https://pypi.org/project/pyrasgo/) - Account required)
- using the Rasgo open-source package ([rasgoql](https://pypi.org/project/rasgoql/) - totally free).

# About Us
Rasgo Transforms are maintained by *[Rasgo](https://rasgoml.com)*. Rasgo's enterprise feature store integrates with your data warehouse to help users build features faster, collaborate with team members, and serve features to models in production.
