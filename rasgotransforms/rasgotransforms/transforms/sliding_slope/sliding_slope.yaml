  Calculates the linear slope on a given row, looking backwards for a user-defined window of periods.

  Pass in a partition_col, an order_col, and a lookback window size. 

  NOTE: Your data should be a properly formatted timeseries dataset before applying this transformation. In other words, each period should only appear once, and periods considered zero should be imputed with 0 already.
  NOTE: Slope calculations are notoriously sensitive to large outliers, especially with smaller windows.

  Example use case: On daily stock data, calculate SLOPE by TICKER, with a 14-period lookback window. 
arguments:
  partition_col:
    type: column
    description: |
      Grouping column to calculate the slope within.
  order_col:
    type: column
    description: Column to order rows by when calculating the agg window. Slope automatically sorts ascending.
  value_col:
    type: column
    description: Column to calulate slope for.
  window:
    type: int
    description: |
      Number of periods to use as a lookback period, to calculate slope. 
example_code: |
  ds = rasgo.get.dataset(fqtn="RASGOCOMMUNITY.PUBLIC.ZEPL_DAILY_STOCK_FEATURES")

  ds2 = ds.sliding_slope(partition_col = 'TICKER', 
                order_col = 'DATE', 
                value_col = 'CLOSE', 
                window = 14)
