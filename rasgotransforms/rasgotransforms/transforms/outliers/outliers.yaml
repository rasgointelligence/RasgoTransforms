description: |
  This function determines which records in the table are an outlier based on a given 
  statistical method (z-score, IQR, or manual threshold) and a target column. It produces 
  a new column named 'OUTLER_<target_column>' which is TRUE for records that are outliers, 
  and FALSE for records that aren't.
arguments:
  target_columns:
    type: column_list
    description: The target columns containing values which will be used to calculate outliers. 
      The z-score or IQR (depending on the selected method) for each column will be calculated 
      independently. If any of the values in the selected columns are an outlier, the row will 
      be flagged as an outlier (or dropped if drop = True).
  drop:
    type: boolean
    description: Whether or not to drop the rows which are determined outliers. If false, a new
      column will be created flagging outliers with a boolean.
  method:
    type: value
    description: The method used to calculate outliers. Supported methods are
      "iqr" which calculates the inter quartile range between the 1st and third quartile
      (IQR) and flags values that are more than 1.5 * IQR from the median, 
      "z-score" which calculates the z-score and flags values with a Z-score more than 
      the provided threshold, and "threshold" which requires and manually set 
      minimum and maximum threshold which are used to flag outliers.
    
      Default Value = "z-score"
  min_threshold:
    type: value
    description: The minimum threshold for values that won't be flagged as outliers.
      Required if method is "threshold".
    is_optional: true
  max_threshold:
    type: value
    description: The maximum threshold for values that won't be flagged as outliers.
      Required if method is "threshold".
    is_optional: true
  max_zscore:
    type: value
    description: The maximum Z-score for values which will not be flagged as an outlier. 
      Default Value = 2
    is_optional: true
