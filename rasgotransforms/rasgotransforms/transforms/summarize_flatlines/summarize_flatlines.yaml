  Given a dataset, searches finds "flatline" sequences of a repeated values that do not change. 
  
  Choose a value column, a column to be used for ordering (such as a date), and a minimum cutoff for the number of repeated occurrences to consider.
   
  The result is a summarized table. 
arguments:
  group_by:
    type: column_list
    description: The column(s) used to partition you data into groups.
      Flatlines (repeated values) will be searched within each group
  value_col:
    type: column
    description: The column for which to search for flatlines.
  order_col:
    type: column
    description: The column used to order the rows within groups.
  min_repeat_count:
    type: int
    description: The minimum length of a sequence of repeated values to consider
