description: Lag shifts your features on a partition index, creating a lookback feature offset by an amount. Lag supports generating multiple lags in one transform by generating each unique combination of columns and amounts from your inputs.
arguments:
  columns:
    type: column_list
    description: names of column(s) you want to lag
  amounts:
    type: int_list
    description: Magnitude of amounts you want to use for the lag. Positive values result in a historical offset; negative amounts result in forward-looking offset.
  partition:
    type: column_list
    description: name of column(s) to partition by for the lag
    is_optional: true
  order_by:
    type: column_list
    description: name of column(s) to order by in the final data set
    is_optional: true
