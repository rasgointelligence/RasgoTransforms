  Row-based; Calculates a cumulative aggregate based on a relative row window.

  Pass in order_by columns to create a row-based look-back or look-forward window.

  Example use case: Aggregate all sales for a customer from the beginning of time until this row.
arguments:
  aggregations:
    type: agg_dict
    description: |
      Dictionary of columns and aggregate functions to apply.
      A column can have a list of multiple aggregates applied.
      One column will be created for each column:aggregate pair.
  order_by:
    type: column_list
    description: Column(s) to order rows by when calculating the agg window
  direction:
    type: value
    description: |
      By default, the cumulative agg will calculate by looking 'backward' across all rows, according to the order_by.
      To override this behavior, use 'forward', and the cumulative will look at each row and all future rows.
    is_optional: True
  group_by:
