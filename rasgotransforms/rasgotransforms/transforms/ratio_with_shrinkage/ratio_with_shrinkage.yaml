description: |
  Performs empirical bayesian estimation with shrinkage towards a beta prior.
  Given a dataset with a numerator and a denominator, will calculate the raw ratio as numerator / denom, 
  as well as provide an adjusted ratio that shrinks the ratio towards the observed beta prior.

  This is a simplified version that establishes the priors directly from the data given a min_cutoff count of observations.

  NOTE: your data should already be aggregated before performing this operation.
arguments:
  numerator:
    type: column
    description: |
      A column that is pre-aggregated to contain the count of positive cases
  denom:
    type: column
    description: |
      A column that is pre-aggregated to contain the count of ALL cases
  min_cutoff:
    type: int
    description: |
      Enter a minimum value to limit the denominator when creating the prior estimates. Example: if estimating a batter's hitting percentage, 
      entering 500 would limit the estimation of the priors to be only for batters with over 500 at-bats.

example_code: |
  ds = rasgo.get.dataset(fqtn="BATTING_AVERAGES")

  ds2 = ds.ratio_with_shrinkage(numerator = 'HITS', 
                denom = 'AT_BATS', 
                min_cutoff = 500)
