description: |
  Retrieves predictions from a DataRobot model that was deployed in Snowflake.
arguments:
  function_name:
    type: value
    description: name of the custom Snowflake function that represents the DataRobot model
  include_cols:
    type: column_list
    description: List of columns to select
  num_explains:
    type: value
    is_optional: true
    description: (Optional) the number of prediction explanations to also retrieve. Prediction explanations are computationally expensive. If you supply num_explains, you must also supply threshold_low and threshold_high.
  threshold_low:
    type: value
    is_optional: true
    description: (Optional) predictions lower than this threshold will also calculate an explanation.
  threshold_high:
    type: value
    is_optional: true
    description: (Optional) predictions higher than this threshold will also calculate an explanation.
