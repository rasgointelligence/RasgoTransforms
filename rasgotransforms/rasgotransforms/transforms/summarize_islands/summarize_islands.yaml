description: |
  Given a dataset with a date column, summarizes the data in terms of `islands`, which are periods of time where data exists. 
  This is often useful in determining if your data has `gaps` where data does not exist, or exists under certain conditions.

  You must set a buffer such as 7 DAYS which will determine the grain of time for which one island stops and another begins. 
   
  The result is a summarized table. 
arguments:
  group_cols:
    type: column_list
    description: The column(s) used to partition you data into groups.
      Islands will be searched within each group
    is_optional: True
  conditions:
    type: math_list
    description: A list of conditions for which to apply to the data before searching for islands. For example, ["COL1 > 0","COL1 IS NOT NULL"]
    is_optional: True
  date_col:
    type: column
    description: The column used to create search for islands. This must be a date or datetime column.
  buffer_date_part:
    type: date_part
    description: A valid SQL datepart to slice the date_col. 
      For interval types, see [this Snowflake doc.](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/data-types-datetime.html#interval-constants)
  buffer_size:
    type: int
    description: | 
      An integer of how many `date_parts` will be considered to be a part of the same island. 
      Larger numbers will cause more overlaps and therefore less islands, and 
      smaller numbers will cause less overlaps and therefore more islands
