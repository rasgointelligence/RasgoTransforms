name: Salesforce Lead Scoring
description: Salesforce tracks individuals through multiple relationship stages, including contact, lead, and opportunity, and ties this to the account. This accelerator joins each Salesforce object together, producing a single table with one row per lead, and determines if the lead is closed won or lost so that you can quickly apply a lead scoring model or other insight.
